Zabbix jmx solr template
========================

This templated is based on template from https://github.com/flaviotorres/zabbix which didn't work for us

It's a pretty basic template currently supporting one collection named collection1. If your collection is named differently please change it according to your requirements.

If you have multiple collections you have to duplicate the keys and change collection names.
